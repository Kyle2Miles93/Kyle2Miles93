### Data professional with training in programming languages (Python, Javascript, C) and Databases. Background in classical music performance on double bass.

* I'm currently learning all facets of Data Science, as well as Calculus, Transmedia Storytelling and C programming.

* I'm looking for help with Machine Learning and Artifical Intelligence - always open to collaborate!

* Ask me about anything music! ðŸŽ¹ ðŸŽ» I play the double bass and am an enthusiast of lesser-known classical and jazz music. I am interested in Natural Language Processing and in addition want to investigate how to model neural networks to create a piece of music using clever software engineering.
